# **Accurate Question Generation using NLP, RAG, and Hugging Face**  

This project focuses on generating highly accurate and context-aware questions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Hugging Face models**. It is designed to enhance automated question creation for educational purposes, quizzes, and knowledge assessment tools.  

## **Key Features**  
- Leverages **RAG** to improve question relevance by retrieving additional contextual knowledge.  
- Uses **state-of-the-art Hugging Face models** for precise and coherent question generation.  
- Supports **custom datasets**, making it adaptable for various domains and applications.  
- Optimized for **high accuracy and contextual understanding**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **NLP techniques** for text processing and understanding.  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for advanced language modeling.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance question quality.  

This project aims to improve AI-driven question generation by combining retrieval and generation techniques, making it a valuable tool for education and automated knowledge testing.
